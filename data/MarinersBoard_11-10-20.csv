Asset on the basepaths and should make some highlight plays in the outfield. Only item left unchecked is how he'll respond to adversity and prolonged slump. Unrelenting desire for greatness suggests he'll be fine. Impact player profile here.,"Slightly open stance with even weight and balance distribution throughout entire operation. Slightly crouched with moderately wide base. Incredibly short to the ball with impressive bat speed. Body movements are synced up and fluid from load through through contact. Head is still. Keeps weight back on all pitches. Finds plenty of barrels in all four quadrants. Attacks velocity at the top of the zone with ease. Mature approach, will take his walks while demonstrating advanced pitch recognition. Can be susceptible to breaking balls from RHP at his back foot and plus breaking stuff away from lefties. Future plus hitter that will play at the top or middle of any lineup.",Optimized kinetic chain through his swing. Shortness to ball allows for big extension and strength out front. Swing plane is geared to drive the ball through the air without selling out for fly balls. Impressive strength in his legs and core help produce big exit velos for his size. Easy plus pull-side power with the ability to drive the occasional fastball over the opposite field wall as well. Middle of the order impact power that he gets to in-game,"Above average defender with impressive instincts and effort/hustle; strong routes and reactions in the outfield; good range in center, may be forced into a corner if the body slows down - should be able to stick in centerfield into him prime. Ranges to his left and to his right; tracks the ball well back to infield; fluid motions and could dissolve if he puts on too much more muscle mass.

Good work ethic, spends countless hours in the cages improving his swing. Genuine belief he and those around him are destined for greatness. Plays a fun brand of baseball. Student of the game, soaks in advice from hitting coaches and teammates. Solid makeup and character.","Since signing as an international amateur free agent with the Mariners in 2017-18, Julio Rodriguez is recognized as one of the most intriguing prospects in baseball. His athletic profile produces consistent triple-digit exit velocities and supreme raw power. His strong arm bodes well to his future in any outfield spot, which makes up for his lack of speed. Rodriguez still needs time to develop complete understanding as a hitter. Maybe the most enticing bat in minor league ball.","Right-handed hit tool that produces consistent hard contact. Consistent barrels. Sound approach to all fields, still a bit more pull-heavy at the moment. Patient approach that works the count with tremendous patience. Hard line-drive outs to the outfield, not many soft ground balls. Impact bat.","Raw, tantalizing power. Bat just sounds different. Jumps on mistakes in the zone with extreme exit velocities. Drives the ball to the gaps for extra bases. Doesn't need much effort to produce home run power. Makes the most of his physical tools, strong upper and lower half stay connected in his swing to drive balls over the fence. Loud power, especially pull-side. Impressive package and work ethic translates to plus-power. Maybe double-plus raw.","Average fielder with good instincts and play on the ball. Lack of speed and athleticism catches up to him at times. Hard-hit balls sail over his head due to bad routes. Hustles to the ball, his frame and size could play all three outfield positions. His strong arm tends to lean to right or center field. More room for improvement as he gets consistent reps at one spot.","Strong, cannon arm that makes throws from every spot in the outfield. Guns down runners reaching for second from the corners. Throws one-hop to home plate from center. Good arm strength to get the ball out quickly. Ball stays low and lacks tail with accuracy and precision. Makes the smart play. Hits the cut-off man when needed. Plus-arm that plays well in the outfield.","Speed is a good for now, but should regress as he ages. Lacks quickness and burst out of the box or in the field. Has long strides, just a bit bulky.

His weight is evenly distributed throughout his wiry arms and legs, with only modest room for muscle growth. Average athleticism. A cerebral pitcher, Gilbert has a reputation for intense study and a drive for self-improvement. Mentally tough, Gilbert is rarely overwhelmed and will make adjustments inning to inning.","Gilbert pairs four average to plus big league pitches with elite extension and solid command. He has the tools to be a middle of the rotation starter and the competitive drive and slow heartbeat to maximize them to land in the top of the rotation. If the changeup develops, Gilbert's ceiling could be as a number two starter. If his stuff stagnates, he still has the current mix of tools and Baseball IQ to stick in the middle of a rotation.",,,,,,"His best pitch, Gilbert's four-seam fastball sits 92-95, t97 with plenty of ride. Fastball plays up as his extension allows him a late release, increasing perceived velocity and adding deception. Generates late life with modest armside run. Possesses above average command and can locate consistently at the top of the zone where it acts as a putaway pitch when paired with his secondary offerings.",,"Gilbert tosses an average curve that flashes above and sits in the mid 70s (74-77). A true 12-6 shape that is distinct from the slider with a spike grip, Gilbert deploys it to steal strikes and set up the high fastball. Early in counts he throws a slow, tumbling breaker that hitters give up on before it pops into the zone, while late in counts he'll throw a sharper breaker that bounces for swings, though it's not as effective as the slider. Shape and break were inconsistent in 2019, but the velo difference allowed Gilbert to freeze hitters even on hangers at the top of the zone. Pitch is most effective to tunnel with the high fastball as hitters had trouble distinguishing the two. Needs to increase consistency and maintain that late break as advanced competition will punish mistakes.","Sitting 82-85, Gilbert's best secondary is a hard, sweeping slider that has taken a step forward as a pro. It's now an above average pitch that flashes plus. He'll throw it to lefties and righties, burying it back-foot to lefties and off the plate to righties. Can throw it for strikes, but is most effective as a two-plane putaway breaker that tunnels with the fastball. Lacks consistency as it can lose shape inning to inning, blending into a hittable slurve. When he has feel, he misses plenty of bats and the pitch looked more consistent in brief looks in 2020.","Sitting 84-87, Gilbert has improved a fading, circle changeup that he throws with consistent arm speed. The pitch sits average with some late sink and fade, but he throws the occasional plus change that falls off the table, hinting at its potential. An underused pitch in 2019, Gilbert deployed it primarily to generate soft contact against lefties, but reports from 2020 intersquad are that changeup development was a focus for Gilbert, with positive early results. This pitch has the most potential to determine Gilbert's ceiling, as an above average or plus changeup will open up the rest of his arsenal and give him another weapon against left handed hitters",,,,,,,"Gilbert reaches back and slings the ball from a 3/4th slot, a result of his long levered, smooth delivery. There's little apparent effort and his frame and motion allows him elite extension (reportedly over seven and a half feet) as he gets down the mound and releases on top of hitters. Finishes slightly off balance, but is consistent and fluid with good hip separation.","A strike-thrower that fills the zone, Gilbert is currently control over command, but his ability to throw all four pitches in the zone keeps hitters guessing. At the big league level he'll need to refine his command to keep hitters off balance, but his easy, repeatable delivery signals at least above average command moving forward.",,,,,http://www.milb.com/images/669302/generic/180x270/669302.jpg

Sloping, broad shoulders with a good track record of health.","At his best, Hancock has shown the ability to be a top of the rotation arm with big stuff across the board. When he's not right, he falls behind in counts and leaves fastballs over the heart of the plate. He'll live and die on fastball command, but if the consistency comes, he could be a top of the rotation horse.",,,,,,93-96/t98 with armside run and sink. Can change orientation to ride at top of the zone. Pitch seems to sometimes lack conviction. Hittable at times. Explosive potential is mechanics and consistency are refined. At it's best the fastball is 95-97/98 with late movement and deception.,,"Low-80s power breaker that wasn't thrown much in college simply because he didn't have to. When thrown, showed good depth and late bite. Average more often than not.","83-86 with tight break. Young pitcher who's still finding feels for optimized breaking ball and ability to throw for strikes. At it's best, the slider has an aggressive horizontal approach angle with late sweep and depth. Definitive out-pitch.","Difference maker. Lots of tumble and fade into righties. Shows good command for the pitch and excellent arm-speed. Deployed slider more often, but changeup more often than not flashed better. May be the second-best pro offering",,,,,,,"Extremely low arm slot with good extension coming from a low 3/4 arm slot. It's a short-arm action akin to that of someone like Max Scherzer. Mechanics are sound and safe. Hancock is quad dominant with good stride. Front side can fly open at times, but otherwise consistent mechanically.","Fastball command will be a big development emphasis. If spotted on corners, Hancock will be a very, very tough at-bat. Secondaries are all impressive and make for a good arsenal, thrown for strikes on most occasions.",,,,,https://www.dropbox.com/s/t3pnd3ed1jtst1x/PLive_Placeholder_Team_Board.png?raw=1

Long arms, high, broad shoulders and barrel chested. Physique is approaching full maturity. Impressive, explosive athletic package. Has added 30 pounds of muscle in last 18 months. Speed has diminished a full grade with added weight.","Very loud, projectable tools across the board. Marte still requires polish on the hit tool and on defense, but both aspects of his game have taken positive steps forward stateside. Still could potentially be a shortstop long-term, though that will likely be answered in the next calendar year. Bat projects best at third base where there stands the potential for an impact, middle of the order stick with all-star potential.","Slightly open stance with high hands and a slight bat waggle. Massive leg kick has been subdued a bit over the last year, but notable leg-kick still present. Pull-heavy at present. Good hip-shoulder separation. Ability to lay-off breaking balls and taking breaking balls the other way has improved. Struggles with offspeed, ambushes fastball. Impressive impact bat that is still immature and developing understanding of sequencing of pitches. Potential middle of the order slugging bat with good hit tool.","Big, strong body with added muscle caters to powerful swing. Hip-shoulder separation and bat path create good barrel velos. Some similarities to Manny Machado swing/bat profile. Already present plus pull-side power. Shows signs of opposite field impact as well. Still young, trajectory of impact middle-of-the-order bat.","Below average defender a year ago. Footwork and timing on the dirt have drastically improved. Arm accuracy now grades fringe average. Body is growing off of shortstop, may be forced to third base. Shows good lateral mobility and explosiveness. Hands are still a work in progress. Arm strength will play beautifully at third base.","Very strong arm. Accuracy has been an issue, though mostly a product of poor footwork and letting the game speed up on him. Has slowed things down a good bit at Summer Camp. Arm will play anywhere on the field, accuracy will dictate whether he can stick on the dirt. Projects best at third base","Previously a double-plus runner, has fallen into plus grade with added weight and mass.

Kirby flashes the ability to miss bats without giving up free bases and avoids mistake pitches. Hitters have to earn it. Prototype frame and added weight should be monumental for his durability. Floor is a backend starter, but if his secondaries can tick up we could be talking about a top-of-rotation guy. Not there yet, but has been trending in the right direction. Fun blend of floor and ceiling who has drawn rave reviews off of the field.",,,,,,"One of the better commanded pitches in baseball. Has sat 91-93 in the past but is now sitting 93-95. Was consistently touching 98-99 in instructs as he has added nearly 15 pounds since the draft. Finds and controls all quadrants of the zone. High usage pitch that is used as a tool to control counts. Good velocity, plus command and late movement help Kirby find the zone without finding barrels.",,"11-5 movement profile is thrown somewhat hard in the low 80's. Arm action doesn't stick out from other offerings and he repeats the pitch well. Not a dynamic chase pitch yet, but he throws it with confidence and finds the zone. Hitters looking fastball are unable to adjust until it's too late. Main weapon used against lefties. Plays above it's grade due to plus command of the pitch.","The more volatile of his breaking pitches. Thrown in the mid to high 80's with sharp bite when it's on, the slider will flash plus and is especially dangerous against righties. He seems less confident with the slider than his curve and command is game to game. Will scrap pitch completely in starts where command of the pitch isn't there for him. Has a chance to develop into his best secondary in time, but command is currently too inconsistent.","Still gaining confidence in his least used pitch. Mimics fastball arm speed and action well. Shows flashes of plus sink and good depth when it's on and keeps solid 8-10 mph velocity separation when it's working. Throws strikes with it, but command isn't as consistent as his fastball, but likely will come with reps. Plus pitch ceiling, but still developing currently.",,,,,,,"Clean, repeatable arm action with an uncanny ability to find consistency with his release point. Length of levers and frame leads to huge extension. Low release height thanks to extension and arm slot. Above average to plus arm speed comes with slight effort but head stays steady. Clean and repeatable with almost surgical precision. Slight rocker step leads into windup with natural delivery and tempo. Torque and shoulder rotation stand out. Easy to see velo projection as he continues to add good weight.","Some of the best control/command in the entire minors and perhaps even in baseball. If command of his secondaries improves to near his fastball level, we could be talking about Bieber level command here.

Overall compact frame due to his size and length, chance to add more girth to his lower half.","Williamson's stuff is eye-popping at times. His fastball has late movement and the type of zip you want to see from a lanky left-hander. His curveball is a great complimentary off-speed pitch to counter the heat with great drop and break out of the zone. His slider and changeup need improvement, but he has the makings of a solid MLB starter if his intriguing arsenal comes together.",,,,,,"Mid-to-high 90s offering that forces a ton of whiffs. Long, wiry frame allows him to get good velocity with late rising action toward the top of the zone. Very effective pitch, electric coming out of his hands. Quick to the plate, and it zips by opposing batters. Gets ahead of the count with the fastball, and utilizes it as a strikeout pitch at times.",,"Mid-70s offering that looks to be his best off-speed pitch. Plenty of depth and break that pairs well with his velocity-packed fastball. Good drop and break out of the zone to force swings and misses. Looks comfortable throwing it from the windup or the stretch, and the result stays the same. Solid off-speed pitch that finishes off hitters with late bite.","Another off-speed pitch with solid break, though not as refined as his curveball. Low-to-mid-80s in velocity, good dive at the end to force whiffs. Not thrown as much, still needs improvement as a consistent third pitch. Can be left hanging over the zone or thrown in the dirt at times. Still has the makings of another hard off-speed pitching with more time.","Work in progress as he develops on the farm. Dip in velocity to the fastball, but a bit flat. Not much spin or deception to it, just a bit of a ""hanger"" at the moment. Rarely thrown, but more confidence and effort has been made to improve it. Can develop into a solid fourth pitch, but for now it's a bit lacking.",,,,,,,"Quick and fluid arm action that goes off without a hitch. Controlled follow through after each pitch. Don't see much effort in his delivery, pretty smooth throughout each pitch. Comfortable keeping the same motion, gets the pitch off in the stretch. Tight and compact. Great extension with each pitch due to his length, let's him tick in velocity. Short, compact delivery that he repeats well. Windup looks a bit slow from a distance, but the ball explodes to the plate. Seems very comfortable from the stretch, delivery shortens up and is quick to get there. Very little effort to reach his peak velocity, as well as optimum break for off-speed pitches. Compact and repeated delivery.","Struggles at times to find his spot consistently.

Pitch shape and command should lend well to future projection.,,"83-85 - Definitely a plus offering. Impressive arm speed for player with his lack of experience. Very good separation off the fastball with similar tunneling characteristics. Late fade and tumble which he commands well, especially on right-handed batters backfoot. Has shown a tendency to overthrow and spike at times. Pitch lives at the bottom of the zone.",,,,,,,"Very good arm speed w/over-the-top delivery. Exceptional deception as ball releases from behind his ear. Hand-break is late with medium arm length. High, aggressive leg kick is well-balanced and leads to big hip drive. Good extension with no energy leakage in lead leg block. No contralateral tilt, though does fall off at times when front side flies open.",Command remains strong for a guy who's missed so much time.

Good height and weight for his position. Athletic profile with broad shoulders. Nothing more to fill out, near full maturity. Fast and athletic on both sides, has a good work ethic. Hustles to first base on groundouts and makes the extra effort on multiple occasions.","Heading into his fifth professional season with his third team, Taylor Trammell is more of a finished product knocking on the door of his MLB debut. His solid hit tool and ability to reach base are his best attributes he's built upon in the minors. Trammell has the physical tools and profile to tap into more power, but he's more gap-oriented than pure pop. His minor swing adjustments with the Padres organization showcased more power last season, but he may not reach his ceiling of 20-plus homers in a season. With his plus-speed and patient approach, he fits the profile of a center fielder, but his lackluster arm may lean more toward left field. After a disappointing 2019 season, it will be interesting to see if Tramell continues his power surge at the plate, and he's likely to reach the big leagues by 2021.","Above-average hit tool with loud contact to right field, more of a pull-heavy approach currently. Finds his pitch and drives it to the gaps in right-center. Quick hands and bat speed, turns on hangers in the zone. Misses or makes soft contact at off-speed pitches away, gets him out of his comfort zone at times. Minor right leg lift in his stance, lets his hands and upper-body strength do most of the work. Solid approach and bat speed helps him make the most of his physical tools.","Solid hit tool, but power still leaves a bit to be desired. Has showcased home run power, more gap power is present. Gets the ball in the air on occasion, and drives the ball deep to right field when he gets a hold of one. Needs to be more selectively aggressive deep in the count to maximize power. Has the work ethic and physical tools to increase his pop. Showed improved power last season in Amarillo, and has the ability to reach double-digit homers at the next level. Still fits the profile of a contact-oriented hitter","Has the makings of an above-average defender with his speed and instincts. Athleticism helps him get a good jump on the ball. Smooth and crisp routes to track the ball in the outfield. Good awareness in key situations, seems to make the right play in any given moment. Few glimpses of some uncommon mistakes and mental errors last season, but solid outfield presence.","Lacks the arm strength and accuracy in left and center field. Throws are off target and struggles to reach home plate from either position. His arm is a significant weakness. Opposing runners test him in the outfield by advancing a base. Arm strength and accuracy concerns makes his future in center field uncertain, may lean more toward left field.","Good speed across the board, major threat as soon as he reaches base. Long, gazelle-like strides and immediate bursts out of the box. Great quickness and jump, but also selectively aggressive stealing a bag. Very smart base stealer, picks his time to go and rarely gets caught. Advances bases and scores on sacrifice flies with ease. Stretches routine doubles into triples.

His fastball continues to tick upward in velocity, making it an effective offering with the late life it has towards the top of the zone. Then's slider is thrown with break at both sides of the plate that plays well off his heater, and his changeup has shown signs of being a plus pitch as it develops.

Solid pitch that could develop over time.","Third and final off-speed offering that looks to be in the developmental stages. Rarely in any count, tends to stick with fastball-slider combination.

Strong arms and quick wrists without much muscle definition. Relaxed and smooth motions, not explosive but easy actions and a slow heartbeat. Could still pack strength in upper half.","Cal is a big bodied athlete with great hands, big power, and the leadership qualities teams look for in a catcher. His hit tool and arm hold him back from the next tier of catching prospects, but the power, patience, framing, and intangibles will carry him to the big leagues and likely a role as an MLB regular. If the hit tool doesn't develop, he profiles as a back-up or an up-and-down guy.","Switch-hitter with the tool at fringe average on both sides of the plate. Stands straight up in the box, rolls hands at the ear, modest step with good weight transfer and an uppercut swing. Swings hard to produce average to above bat speed, power coming from legs. Has good command of the strike zone. Current swing has some loop that allows him to elevate pitches low in the zone, but struggles against good velo, particularly at the top. Tendency to swing under balls, resulting in popups. Could improve with more reps and a lower set position that would create less movement through his swing. Likely tops out at an average hit tool","Strong with above average raw power. His upper cut swing combined with a solid approach allows him to get to it in games. Uses lower body to get power to pull side with good hip separation, but has the strength to hit the ball out the other way and up the middle. Great sound coming off the bat, pure strength to tap into more as he develops at the plate.","A former high school infielder, Raleigh has soft, quick hands that allow him to be a plus framer low in the zone with subtle glove movements and noticeably smooth motions. Big strides made defensively in 2019, owing in part to resting on one knee to gain stability. Glowing reports on his attitude, work ethic, and rapport with pitchers; a confident leader in the clubhouse. Can get sloppy with footwork on pitches in the dirt, but defense has been the largest improvement since the draft, indicating his coachability and drive.","Fringe average arm, clocked pop time between 1.95-2.03. Quick exchange, average footwork, and average arm strength. Struggled to throw out runners in 2019, accuracy of throws a larger issue than pure arm strength or exchange.

Deloach moves well when he gets underway but can struggle with his first step. Fairly mature body that will likely require a sacrifice of speed to add strength.,"Deloach stands out for his overall, across the board skillset than any one tool. Currently, Deloach is average or better across the board with no true plus tools. That said, he has consistently been trending upwards and I wouldn't be shocked to see each tool tick up a half-grade. There is a good chance we haven't seen Delaoch's best baseball yet and he receives rave reviews for his work ethic and off the field drive to improve. For now, he profiles as a starting corner outfielder and #2 type hitter.","Switched from a high leg kick to a toe-tap approach in summer of 2019 with great success. Deloach rocks back a simple toe-tap before sliding his momentum forward. Incredibly quiet hands/wrists until he unleashes his swing. Hips stand out. Syncs his movements well and can really explode when he commits. Simple, fairly compact swing that has added some natural loft over the last year and should lead to consistent contact. Patience and vision stand out as plus tools. Controls the strike zone well, waits on his pitch and looks to drive the ball in his counts. Can get caught playing cricket on low and outside spin on occasions. Has bouts of defensive swings when he falls behind in counts. Is at his best when he fully commits and turns his hips loose. Overall a nice combination of contact, approach and the basis for quality contact. Above average tool that will flash plus but isn't quite there yet.","Deloach is fairly short and compact to the ball, but has an optimized bat path geared towards consistent, lofted contact. Deloach will have bouts of defensive swings but has trended towards swinging with intent over the 2020 season. Deloach's swing allows him to get extended well out in front and his patient approach allows him to see many favorable counts. Hips look explosive to me and he syncs everything up well, flashing plus bat and hand speeds. After just 5 HR over 118 college games in 2018/2019, Deloach has shown both wood bat power in the cape and hit 6 HR in just 18 games with a metal bat in 2020. Easy average power that could trend towards above average and should play up in games due to his approach and bat path","Fairly average across the board here. Deloach moves well underway in the outfield but is held back by a mediocre first-step and non-optimal routes. His natural speed gives him an outside shot at center, but he would need to improve his instincts significantly to stick there. He currently projects as a rangy but slightly erratic corner outfielder, with right field as a likely destination.","Deloach's arm is average to a tick above. He has decent carry and is fairly consistent with his angles. Arm strength has flashed above average in 2020 but over a limited sample size. Enough here to play at all three outfield positions, but not a plus tool.","Deloach was a rare case of adding speed as he added weight. Bulked up to 210, Deloach has begun to flash legitimate plus run times in 2020. Right now, his long speed plays above his short area quickness, causing me to be a bit more conservative with his run grade in a baseball environment. That said, the man certainly moves well and if the team can improve his first step, he could really improve as a base stealing threat and in the outfield.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.dropbox.com/s/t3pnd3ed1jtst1x/PLive_Placeholder_Team_Board.png?raw=1

His stout frame has appeared filled out since high school, but he is still converting more weight into lean muscle each year. The concern, though, is that continuing to pack on muscle may result in further loss of flexibility and agility (which Rizzo can't afford to lose if he wants to stick anywhere but first base).","Joe Rizzo is lost in the shuffle of Seattle's big name prospects and is sliding precariously down the defensive spectrum while his bat has yet to deliver above average production--a damning prognosis. But Rizzo is still only 22, has shown the ability to make adjustments, and has the drive and work ethic to transform his profile in an offseason. There's a chance Rizzo unlocks nascent power while retaining his feel to hit through one crucial swing change. The issue, though, is that Rizzo is now relying on a big step forward to save him from dropping fully off the organization's radar. This year will be critical for Rizzo to prove that he can carve out space for himself on a major league diamond.","Rizzo's loudest tool is the short, left handed stroke that carries his profile. His swing has undergone adjustments over the last two years, eliminating and then adding a stride, closing and opening the stance, lowering and then raising his hands, all in an attempt to locate that balance of contact and power that would allow him to reach his second round ceiling. While the swing has fluctuated and continues to undergo adjustments (another swing change in 2020 will debut in 21) Rizzo has never truly lost his above average bat-to-ball skills owed to his quick wrists, strong forearms, and excellent hand-eye-coordination. He has a solid idea of the strike zone which puts him in favorable counts and allows him to spray low line drives across the diamond.","Despite his positional profile and several swing adjustments, Rizzo has never shown above average, or even average, pop as a pro. His compact swing is built for contact and low line drives. Thus far, blasting balls over the fence with regularity has remained unchecked on Rizzo's wish list. He did reach double digit home runs in 19 and will shoot the gaps, but his exit velocities don't scream ""untapped, corner infield power."" Rumor has it Rizzo has added significant muscle in the offseason and adjusted his bat path once more, but we have yet to see if that will unlock the necessary loft and velocity to profile for corner power without sacrificing his ability to make contact.","Rizzo's defense has been in question since the day he was drafted, lacking the natural athleticism and range for the middle of the diamond and without the frame to profile for third. As a pro he's received looks at third, first, and second, but his best position is still lining up on the left side of the plate. He has soft, quick hands, smooth transfers, and has improved at third the last two years, handling in-between hops and charging balls with more confidence. But his limited range, slow footwork, and average athleticism indicate he will never be an above average defender. There's not much upside to uncover defensively, and Rizzo will likely profile as a defensively below average infield utility player, average at first, or fringe average in the hot corner.","Short arm motion from a  slot, Rizzo doesn't have a cannon but he can make all the routine throws from third. He gets good carry and has improved his accuracy through improved footwork. It's an arm that could play in left with some adjustments, but current motions are ideal for infield.","Rizzo is an instinctual runner, but a below average one (and not a pretty one). Choppy, top-heavy, and high effort, Rizzo lacks natural burst to beat out grounders or steal bases. He has great instincts on the bases and avoids mistakes but is teetering on being slapped with the ""lumbering"" label.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.milb.com/images/666143/generic/180x270/666143.jpg

Not very smooth, repeatable or consistent, but still effective. Ball comes out quick and keeps batters off guard. May see some effort concerns with his delivery, nothing ""violent"" just something to keep an eye on moving forward.","Struggles to consistently find the zone and hit his spot. Has trouble locating fastball on the outside corner to righties. Slider may break way inside the plate for an easily called ball. When falling behind in the count, he battles back with a few good placed fastballs or sliders. When his control is good, he gets out of jams with RISP with a softly hit ground ball, possible double play. Still struggles to hit his target consistently, and it leads to several walks in an outing.",,,,,http://www.milb.com/images/670090/generic/180x270/670090.jpg

Room for another 10 pounds or so. Pretty even weight distribution throughout his body, could potentially add velocity by strengthening his lower half a bit. Good athlete who stood out with the bat as well. Competitor makeup.","A TJS survivor from his senior year from New York, we really only have his junior year summer to go on for a healthy Limoncelli, but that performance was very encouraging. Prior to injury, Limoncelli was getting late day one hype and had ""helium"" hype. His natural blend of athleticism, control and physical projection is one that the Mariners have had great success with in recent years. He draws plus reviews on and off the field for his makeup. Potential breakout player in the system if fully healthy. Some relief risk given the injury history, frame and lack of a true solid changeup.",,,,,,"Fastball sits in the mid to low 90's when healthy. Fairly average movement profile in the past (though Wiener and Co have been wizards at optimizing this pitch) with his 4S. Plus arm speed and projection indicate a velocity uptick could be coming. Finds the zone well with the pitch. Currently control over command. 88-90 2S is used as a weapon against left-handed hitters. Also thrown consistently for strikes. Right now, it's an average fastball, but the tools are there for it to jump a grade.",,This is easily Limoncelli's best pitch. Mid 70's velocity with more power coming. Limoncelli clearly has a natural feel for spin and control/command of the pitch is well beyond his years. Big bend creates swing and miss but it's the ability to locate that makes the pitch devastating. Easy above average pitch that becomes plus with a tick of added power.,,"This is a developing pitch for Limoncelli, who had little need to use the pitch as a cold-weather prep arm. He finds the zone with the pitch that sits 83-85. He mimics his FB arm-action well, but the pitch can blend in with the fastball movement and needs to add a bit more velocity separation to work against better hitters. Enough here to use against lefties but the pitch clearly hasn't reached it's ceiling yet. Should be enough here to become average with time, but not there yet.",,,,,,,"Loose arm action that he repeats well despite some effort to his delivery. Arm speed stands out and indicates a chance to increase velocity with added strength. Will need to revisit after seeing his post TJS delivery. Loose, high  delivery that is repeated well despite some effort. Repeats his release points well with all three offerings. Generally shows good composure from the stretch. Could use MLB level coaching to tone down the effort in the finish of his delivery.","Control is above command now, but Limoncelli pounds the zone with all four pitches. He repeats his release well and given his natural athleticism, that should continue. Command is still coming with reps and coaching, but he still has well above average command for his age and background. Average right now, with a realistic chance to take another step forward.",,,,,https://www.dropbox.com/s/t3pnd3ed1jtst1x/PLive_Placeholder_Team_Board.png?raw=1

He's an above average athlete who moves well on and off the mound, relying on rhythm to repeat delivery.","Sweet has seen major improvement in his profile from undrafted flier, to reliever, to a starter who saw great results in the low minors. He relies on a plus change that he can sink or fade to put guys away and keep them off of an average fastball. His breaking pitch is infrequent and inconsistent. Despite possessing the command and stamina of a starter, his repertoire still best profiles in the pen as a multi-inning relief option. If his breaking ball takes a big step forward he may stick in the rotation, but his easiest and most likely path to the big leagues is to lean on his best pitch and hope the fastball ticks up in shorter stints.",,,,,,"While the fastball took a jump in 2019 (he scrapped an ineffective two seamer) and is now up to 90-93, t95, it is still a fringe-average offering with decent ride at the top of the zone. He gets the most out of it, though, as it tunnels with the changeup and has enough command to keep hitters off the barrel. He knows how to use the pitch and works it up in the zone for punchouts, but will struggle to get the same results against more advanced competition.",,"Sweet's breaking pitch has been labeled a slider and a curve, and the lack of industry consensus are indicative of the lack of a distinctive shape or action. While it might be two separate pitches, the breaking pitch has a slight hump and some 3/4th tilt that Sweet lands for strikes. It can flash average when he buries it, but it plays best on the edges of the zone as it's not tempting enough when off the plate. To stick as a starter, Sweet will need to refine his breaking pitch to keep hitters from staying on the fastball the second and third time through the order.",,"Sweet's premier offering, his changeup has plus action, with late fade and sink that resembles a splitter. It's a swing and miss pitch that carries his profile and elevates the rest of his arsenal. He can throw it to lefties and righties, in the zone or diving below. It will still straighten out and get crushed on occasion, but it is an impressive major league caliber offering. Further development and consistency are what will make or break his chance at a major league role.",,,,,,,"A quick worker, Sweet rocks and fires through a high 3/4th slot. A clean and simple delivery that features modest effort. Sweet has the athleticism to repeat the delivery but the reliance on balance and rhythm can lead to inconsistency as he fatigues.","With average to above control and average command, Sweet is consistently around the plate with all three of his pitches. He will locate at the top of the zone with the fastball and drop the changeup on the edge or bury it with enough regularity that hitters have a tough time laying off.

Frame isn't the most projectable, but his body composition is fairly young and he will likely shift to more muscle over the next few years. Should wind up in the 200 pound range at maturity but is certainly not a physical specimen. Average athlete overall, but packs more strength than you'd guess based off of physical appearance. Strong lower half.","There is risk to Rodriguez in that he's a hit tool first prospect that likely will need to alter his swing at some point. The track record of corner outfield prospects who don't hit for power isn't exactly glowing. That being said, you can't teach Rodriguez's natural internal timing skills nor his natural feel for the barrel and as long as he hits, he will continue to factor into the teams long term plans. A fun tidbit is that he is longtime friends with Noelvi Marte, growing up in the same city (Cotui) just a year apart.","Simple lower half with a fairly wide base. Lower half movement is muted, which is necessary due to a fairly busy upper half. Unconventional hitting mechanics in the upper half with a notable drawback in his hands as he starts his swing prevents him from taking a steeper angle with his bat path. That said, he does seem to time everything out exceptionally well. Consistent, loud, line-drive oriented contact with quick, strong wrists. Very good eye and plus bat to ball skills. All fields approach and goes with the pitch. Main concern is that his natural contact and timing abilities with his current swing will prevent him from risking a swing change until the upper minors. Overall, a very good feel for contact and feel for the strike zone.","Rodriguez packs more raw punch than you'd expect for his size and the ball jumps off of his bat. Unfortunately, a flat bat path significantly holds back his power ceiling and his current swing mechanics would make adding loft fairly difficult. That said, the loud contact and exit velocities are there for this tool to jump in the future. Raw power currently plays above in game. Upside is there for average or better power in games, but until the bat path changes it won't be unlocked.","Rodriguez, signed as a center fielder, has since shifted to right field. His defense has improved steadily, with just one error in 41 games in 2019. He has decent range with an average arm currently and projects to stick in right field long term.","Limited sample size to look at, but Rodriguez has a solid arm with average carry for a corner outfielder and solid accuracy. He could tick up a half grade in this area as he continues to put on good weight spending time in the weight room.","Rodriguez is a solid average runner currently. He has good first step instincts that help him with jumps, but he does project to slow down a tick as he matures. That could be counteracted as he shifts his body to good weight however and the Mariners have been among the league's best in this regard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.milb.com/images/679754/generic/180x270/679754.jpg
